___
The privacy policy below is effective as of March 26, 2020 and applies to the Word Sprint app.
___
I, Brandon Suen, created this app with your privacy as one of my top priorities. Because I too use many apps, I understand the confusion and frustration that comes when apps request unnecessary information and use information for questionable purposes. Please read through this policy so that you are aware of what the usage of this app entails. If you disagree with this policy, please cease use of this app. By using this app, you agree to this policy.

## Information collected
This app does not use any directly personally identifiable information (such as your name or email address). Certain information may, however, be automatically collected for legitimate security and business purposes. This information includes payment records if you’ve paid to remove ads; any crashes or errors you’ve experienced; your IDFA (Advertising Identifier); your IDFV (Identifier for Vendor); your installation UIUD; instance IDS; usage data that will allow for ads to be better personalized to you (unless opted out of); and analytical data including how long you’ve been using the app, what screens you navigate to, what buttons you click on, and other analytics indicating how you interact with the app.

## How collected information is used
Word Sprint may collect data on payment records from paying to remove advertisements. This data may be used for security purposes and verification that the purchases are valid.

Word Sprint’s analytics data is processed using Google Analytics for Firebase. Because your analytical data may be shared with this third party service, you should visit their [Use Policy](https://firebase.google.com/policies/analytics) for more information. Word Sprint may use the data processed by Google Analytics for Firebase in order to make marketing decisions or changes to the app itself based on user interaction with the app.

Word Sprint’s analytics data concerning crashes and errors is processed using Crashlytics. Because your analytical data may be shared with this third party service, you should visit their [Terms of Service](https://firebase.google.com/terms/crashlytics) for more information. Word Sprint may use the data processed by Crashlytics in order to make fixes to the app based on any bugs, errors, or crashes users are experiencing.

Word Sprint’s advertisements are served using AdMob. Because your IDFA, usage data, and data to serve ads better personalized to you (unless opted out of) may be shared with this third party service, you should visit their [policies and restrictions](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en) for more information.

## How long collected data is retained
Your data will be retained only for as long as there is an ongoing legitimate business purpose for its retention. Your personal data processed by Google Analytics for Firebase will be retained for no longer than 14 months. Your personal data processed by Crashlytics will be retained for no longer than 90 days.

## Changes to your data
Because this app does not use any directly personally identifiable information, we do not offer any means to change collected information.

## Third party links
Word Sprint may contain links to third party websites or apps. It is advised that you review the content quality and privacy practices of these third parties before clicking on links, because Word Sprint is not responsible for the content quality or privacy practices of these third parties.

## European Economic Area residents
European Economic Area residents have various rights regarding data protection. These include the right to be informed, to access personal data, to request to alter or erase personal data, to restrict personal data processing, to data portability, and to object to the processing of personal data.

## Do-Not-Track signals
Do-Not-Track (DNT) signals have not yet been uniformly adopted on the platforms on which Word Sprint operates; thus, Word Sprint doesn’t respond to any DNT signals yet.

## Changes to this policy
Changes to this policy may occur. If this privacy policy is changed after the user accepts the privacy policy, the user will be alerted of the change after updating the app and opening it. The date on which the latest changes to this policy were put into effect can be seen at the top of the policy.
