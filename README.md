The privacy policy below is effective as of January 26, 2020 and applies to the Word Sprint app.
___
I, Brandon Suen, created this app with your privacy as one of my top priorities. Because I too use many apps, I understand the confusion and frustration that comes when apps request unnecessary information. Please read through this policy so that you are aware of what the usage of this app entails. I designed this app to involve as little user data collection as possible; however, if you disagree with this policy, please cease use of this app. By using this app, you agree to this policy.

## Information used
The only information this app records, excluding information collected from third party services, is stored locally on your phone, not on any databases that this app can access and share information from. This information includes whether or not you have accepted the terms and conditions and privacy policy, whether or not you've removed ads, and information about the games you've played so we can show you your statistics. That's it!

## Advertisements and third party services
This app employs the use of Admob and Firebase. Admob is a third party service that is used in this app to serve advertisements. Firebase is another third party service that is used in this app to collect statistics. These third party service may collect information regarding your usage of this app. You should look over the privacy policies of these services for more information.

## Deleting your data
Because your information isn't scored on any databases for this app, uninstalling the app will remove this app's access to your data entirely, with the exception of usage data collected by Admob and Firebase.

## European Economic Area residents
European Economic Area residents who believe that this app is handling personal information in an unlawful manner have the right to contact local data protection authorities.
